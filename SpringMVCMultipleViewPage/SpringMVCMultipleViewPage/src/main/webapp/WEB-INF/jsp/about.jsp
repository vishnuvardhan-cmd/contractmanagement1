<h1><font color="azure">ABOUT US</font></h1><br><br>
<br><br><p><font color="azure">Contact management is the process of recording contacts details and tracking their interactions with a business.Such systems have gradually evolved into an aspect of customer relationship management (CRM) systems, which allow businesses to improve sales and service levels leveraging a wider range of data.<br><br>
Contact management quickly evolved from Rolodex and Filofax systems into desktop-based contact management software and email clients with built-in contact management tools.<br><br><br>

Yet despite these significant technical advances, many businesses found that their contact management systems fundamentally amounted to little more than a simple database containing names, phone numbers and notes.<br><br><br>

As the categories of sales management and contact management software have grown closer in recent years, enterprises started to appreciate the benefits of unified processes and systems capable of capturing a wider range of business data.<br><br><br>

Taking contact management to the next level
By combining the tracking of contacts, their interactions with the business, and their preferences and service issues, it became possible to create a single, unified view of the customer -- vital data not only for a successful sales team, but also for the delivery of excellent customer service.<br><br><br>

To maximise the value of this data, what was needed was a fundamental move beyond a sophisticated contact book, and towards processes and systems that track the entire customer journey from start to end â€“ and then connect those to products</font></p>
